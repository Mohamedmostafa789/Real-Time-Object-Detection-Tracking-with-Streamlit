# **Project Name: Real-Time Object Detection & Tracking with Streamlit**  

## **Project Description**  

This project is a **real-time object detection and tracking system** built using **Streamlit**, **YOLOv8**, and **Kalman filtering**. It provides an interactive and visually appealing way to detect objects from a live video feed, apply motion tracking, and visualize object movement with heatmaps.  

With a seamless **web-based UI powered by Streamlit**, users can enable object detection, visualize real-time video feeds, and analyze object movement. Additionally, a **Kalman Filter-based laser tracking simulation** demonstrates noise reduction and prediction capabilities in a dynamic system.

## **Key Features**  

### ðŸ”¹ **Live Video Processing with Streamlit**  
- Uses **Streamlit** to create an **interactive web-based UI**.  
- Displays **real-time video feed** from a webcam.  
- Allows users to enable/disable **object detection dynamically** using a simple checkbox.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8**  
- Integrates **YOLOv8 Nano** for **fast and accurate** object detection.  
- Detects multiple objects in real-time and **draws bounding boxes** with class labels and confidence scores.  
- Stores **object positions** to analyze movement patterns.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Kalman Filter-Based Object Tracking**  
- Implements a **Kalman Filter** for simulating **laser-based tracking**.  
- Predicts and corrects object movements **despite noisy measurements**.  
- Compares **true distance, noisy sensor data, and Kalman-filtered results** in a detailed **matplotlib visualization**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Heatmap for Object Movement Analysis**  
- Uses **Seaborn heatmaps** to visualize **the frequency of detected object positions**.  
- Displays **hotspots of movement** to analyze object paths dynamically.  
- Helps in understanding **crowd density, motion trends, and tracking data** over time.
